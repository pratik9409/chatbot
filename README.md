# chatbot

We use chatbots to engage with customers alongside the classic customer service channels like phone, email, website, and social media.
A chatbot, unlike a customer support agent, never takes breaks, sleeps or goes offline. With chatbots, businesses can provide 24/7 customer support.

Created a simple chatbot with implemented a Feed Forward Neural Net with 2 hidden layers.
Also created intents.json file for the input to train the model. The intents.json file can be customized with different possible patterns and responses.

To run the model
First run the train.py file, that will dump the data.pth file.
Then run the chat.py file
